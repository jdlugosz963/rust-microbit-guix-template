#+TITLE: Rust microbit guix template

* What's that?
- If you are a hipster like me, and you want to hack on your microbit
  with Rust using a Guix machine, then you couldn't find better
  place!! I prepared this repo especially for that case, so you can
  hop straight to concrete!
- If you ever use this, let me know. It took some time before I
  figured out how to do this XD.

* How to run?
- To pull this repo, you can use =cargo generete=, like this:
  #+begin_src sh
    cargo generate --git {{this repo url}}
  #+end_src

- You need to have a rustup guix channel pulled:
  #+begin_src scheme
    ;; ~/.config/guix/channels.scm
    (cons (channel
           (name 'rustup)
           (url "https://github.com/declantsien/guix-rustup")
           (introduction
            (make-channel-introduction
             "325d3e2859d482c16da21eb07f2c6ff9c6c72a80"
             (openpgp-fingerprint
              "F695 F39E C625 E081 33B5  759F 0FC6 8703 75EF E2F5"))))
          %default-channels)
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src sh
    guix pull
  #+end_src

- Then simply run =./dev-shell.sh= and whole dev environment should be
  working!

- To compile and write program on microbit, you can run this command: =cargo embed=

* Extra
- At the time I wrote this and everything was working fine, I was using these channels:
  #+begin_src scheme
    ;; ~/.config/guix/channels.scm
    (list (channel
           (name 'rustup)
           (url "https://github.com/declantsien/guix-rustup")
           (branch "master")
           (commit
            "190a3e434eea18135a9bb44a7bc61ca023d72dbe")
           (introduction
            (make-channel-introduction
             "325d3e2859d482c16da21eb07f2c6ff9c6c72a80"
             (openpgp-fingerprint
              "F695 F39E C625 E081 33B5  759F 0FC6 8703 75EF E2F5"))))
          (channel
           (name 'guix)
           (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")
           (branch "master")
           (commit
            "027a35dff89cbb35512afee4f4a78ae103a2f484")
           (introduction
            (make-channel-introduction
             "9edb3f66fd807b096b48283debdcddccfea34bad"
             (openpgp-fingerprint
              "BBB0 2DDF 2CEA F6A8 0D1D  E643 A2A0 6DF2 A33A 54FA")))))
  #+end_src
